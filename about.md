I'm a student at the University of Chicago, studying applied math and economics.

Looking for additional research/work opportunities; I have a lot of free time through the beginning of October, courtesy of the pandemic. Are you helping the world or solving some problem? Let me know; I'd love to join you.

Reach out to me at [nhaksar@uchicago.edu](mailto:nhaksar@uchicago.edu).
